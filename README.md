## Dependencies

### Build dependencies

## Installation

### Build from source code

1. Make sure you have installed all dependencies.
```bash
sudo apt build-dep dde-session-shell
```

2. Build
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

3. Install
```bash
sudo make install
```

4. debian/rules

```makefile
override_dh_auto_configure:
	dh_auto_configure -- \
		-DWAIT_DEEPIN_ACCOUNTS_SERVICE=1
```
lightdm-deepin-greeter strongly relies on the com.deepin.daemon.Accounts service(created by dde-system-daemon). We use WAIT_DEEPIN_ACCOUNTS_SERVICE to control whether to wait for the service to start when the program starts. If dde-system-daemon will not be started in the desktop environment, please set this value to 0, otherwise the deepin-lightdm-greeter will get stuck.
